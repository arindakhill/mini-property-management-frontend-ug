## Property Management Portal - Frontend

The Property Management Portal is a sophisticated web application designed to facilitate a seamless and efficient exchange of information between property owners and potential tenants or buyers. Drawing inspiration from platforms like Zillow.com, this system offers a rich, user-friendly interface tailored to meet the diverse needs of its users.

## Overview

This portal serves as a dynamic marketplace for real estate, where owners can list properties for sale or rent, and customers can easily find and apply for properties that match their requirements. With four distinct roles - Owner, Admin, Customer, and Viewer - the platform ensures a tailored experience for each user type, enhancing usability and engagement.

### Roles and Features

- **Viewer**: Unregistered users who can search for and view property listings.
- **Owner**: Property owners who wish to list their properties for rent or sale, providing detailed information such as room count, price, and more.

- **Customer**: Users looking for properties to rent or buy, capable of searching listings based on specific criteria and submitting applications for properties of interest.

### Key Functionalities
